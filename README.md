# GameYourLife
Introduction:
- Let imagine that your life can be treated as a game, where activities turn into interesting missions. 
- Each time you complete a task, you will receive a reward. And more interesting, you can level up yourself.
- The challenges will be harder over time, which gradually make you stronger.
- You can easily check your progress, achievements, and current position in a game.
- Yes, and if you can treat tasks in life as a game, you can play it 8 hours per day without feeling bored.
- And that is also my final objective.

Environment:
- I implemented this project in C#, .Net first. Because the time for visualization is too much, I want to complete the core before doing the display part.
- This is also an opportunity for me to learn plain C#. Unity is strong enough for us to develop without understanding the core C# below. After this, maybe I can learn how to combine plain C# with C# in Unity. That will be a great journey.
